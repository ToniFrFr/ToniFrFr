Hello, welcome to my GitHub!
In here you will find the repositories to the projects that I've been part of. Please, have a look! ðŸ‘€

Mostly focus in the projects has been on embedded programming (C/C++) of the embedded devices and their components themselves, but I've also been a part of developing
the front-end side of a Web UI to follow/monitor the data sent by the embedded device. My passion lies within embedded programming, although I do find the entire
world of the IoT extremely interesting.
